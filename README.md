## Step Into Automation

### BUREAU
**BU**siness **RE**adable **AU**tomation
 
 A freshly written abstraction library for Selenium - which allows for language chaining,
 simplifying the automation. It allows us to chain actions on the same element (including
 waits as standard), making the process of writing test code faster.
 Written with self documentation and ease of use in mind.
 
 It uses promises and asynchronous functionality, as well as capturing some of the more 
 common errors, and includes a bare-bones functional library to click, find and check 
 visibility of elements, wait functionality, simple browser interactions and basic url   
 navigation.
 
 
### SIA Runner
 This is for running the documentation software and the test suite.
 
 Use `node ./sia.js -h` for the help docs
 
 Written in JavaScript, so that it can more easily integrate with future developments, such 
 as running framework setups for different projects, report functionality, internal tests, 
 parallel test execution with various overrides to the config (for cross-browser testing and 
 general improvement of test execution time) and a host of other things.
